# Binomial Model Project: Popt_12_step1_DataMove

To achieve significant performance acceleration we need to change the way data is transferred between Host and Global Memory and Global memory and a kernel. Such solution is represented in this project.

At this step of the tutorial only SW Emulation and HW Emulation steps are used (skipping compilation for System Run).

Please refer to the [BinomialModel.pdf] document for detailed information regarding design setup, execution and results comparison.
