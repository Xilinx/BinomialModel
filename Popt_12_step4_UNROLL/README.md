# Binomial Model Project: Popt_12_step4_UNROLL

This project demonstrates a possibility to further improve the performance by increasing the level of parallelism via partial loop unrolling. 

At this step of the tutorial only SW Emulation and HW Emulation steps are used (skipping compilation for System Run).

Please refer to the [BinomialModel.pdf] document for detailed information regarding design setup, execution and results comparison.
