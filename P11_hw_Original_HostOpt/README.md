# Binomial Model Project: P11_hw_Original_HostOpt

In this project, using the same original Binomial Model kernel implementation (represented in P10_hw_Original) we improve the performance by overlapping data transfer with kernel execution (host code optimization).  

Please refer to the [BinomialModel.pdf] document for detailed information regarding design setup, execution and results comparison.
