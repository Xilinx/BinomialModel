# Binomial Model Project: Popt_12_step3_ARRAY_PARTITION

This project represents a 2nd step of a solution allowing to process four (4) test vectors simultaneously.

At this step of the tutorial only SW Emulation and HW Emulation steps are used (skipping compilation for System Run).

Please refer to the [BinomialModel.pdf] document for detailed information regarding design setup, execution and results comparison.
