# Binomial Model Project: Popt_12_step2_FUNx4

This project represents a 1st step of a solution allowing to process four (4) test vectors simultanously.

At this step of the tutorial only SW Emulation and HW Emulation steps are used (skipping compilation for System Run).

Please refer to the [BinomialModel.pdf] document for detailed information regarding design setup, execution and results comparison.
